Splunk

->Tool in which machine data is processed to extract data.
->Forwarders : Collecting data and forwarding it to splunk instances.
->Indexers: Place where data is stored.
->Search Head: It is what users interact with(Web Interface).

DATA <------------------<index>----------->Users

		:Data indexes act as a bridge here(or it is a table of databases.)

SPL (search processing language)

->Splunk Data Pipeline
	Input     :Forwarded data,uploaded data,network data,scripts
	Parsing   :Examins data and adds metadata
	Indexing  :Data divided into events.Writes the data to the disk in "buckets"(sub-directories).
	Searching :User interaction with the data

->forwarders Two types
	:Lightweight Forwarders
	:Heavy Forwarders

->Splunk Enterprise
     S1(Single Server)->search head and Indexer are same splunk component
		      ->small no. of users
		      ->used for non-critical data
     C1/C11(Distributed Clustered Deployment-Single site)
			->one or more standalone search heads
			->indexer cluster with data replication
			->Multiple,load balanced collection inputs
     C3/C13(Distributed Clustered Deployment with SHC - Single site)
			->Search head cluster -> Deployer
			->Indexer Cluster -> Cluster Manager

->How spunk stores Data
	:A repository for splunk data
	:transforms incoming data into events and stores it in indexes
	:An event is a single row data,made up of fields(key value pairs).
	:Spunk add default field to all events.
		->time (UNIX time)
		->index (at which data is stored).
		->Host (name and IP address)
		->source(file stream or other inputs from which event originates).
		->source type(Format of data)

	:TYPES OF BUCKETS in indexes
		->Hot(actively written and searched) 
		->warm(no active writing) 
		->cold		
		->froze (splunk deletes frozen bucket by default but can also chose a different place for archieval purpose).
		->Thawed (when data is restored it goes to thawn bucket).

->SmartStore: Allows to use remote object stores like AWS S3 etc.
->splunk cloud and Splunk enterprise
->Only Splunk vetted apps can be installed in Splunk Cloud.
